## Expanded API Endpoints

### Social Interaction Endpoints
- `POST /api/users/follow/:userId`
- `DELETE /api/users/unfollow/:userId`
- `GET /api/users/followers`
- `GET /api/users/following`

### Messaging Endpoints
- `GET /api/messages/:matchId`
- `POST /api/messages/send`
- `GET /api/conversations`

### Onboarding Endpoints
- `GET /api/onboarding/questions`
- `POST /api/onboarding/submit-responses`

## Onboarding Flow Design

### Comprehensive Onboarding Strategy
1. Initial Registration
2. Profile Basic Information
3. Detailed Personality Questions
   - Compatibility assessment
   - Interest profiling
   - Relationship goals
4. Preference Configuration
5. Photo Upload
6. Initial Recommendation Generation

### Onboarding Question Categories
- Personality Traits
- Lifestyle Preferences
- Relationship Expectations
- Personal Interests
- Values and Beliefs

## Real-time Messaging with Socket.IO

### Socket Events
- `connect`: User connection
- `disconnect`: User disconnection
- `message:send`: Send message
- `message:read`: Message read status
- `typing`: User typing indicator
- `match:notification`: New match notification

## Matchmaking and Recommendation Engine

### Recommendation Algorithm Components
1. Collaborative Filtering
2. Content-based Filtering
3. Hybrid Approach
   - Machine Learning Model
   - TensorFlow.js Integration

### Recommendation Scoring Factors
- Geographical Proximity
- Shared Interests
- Personality Compatibility
- Interaction History
- Profile Completeness
- Mutual Followers/Connections

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Caching Mechanisms
- Redis for user profiles
- Memcached for frequently accessed data
- Intelligent cache invalidation

### Query Optimization
- Indexed MongoDB queries
- Aggregation pipeline for complex matching
- Denormalized data structures

### Latency Reduction Techniques
- Microservices architecture
- Asynchronous processing
- Precomputed recommendation cache
- Edge computing for global distribution

## Advanced Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Multi-factor authentication
- Advanced bot detection
- Consent-based data sharing
- GDPR and CCPA compliance

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling
- Load balancing
- Stateless authentication
- Distributed caching
- Message queue for background jobs

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Real-time performance tracking
- User engagement metrics
- Recommendation algorithm effectiveness
- Error tracking and logging

## Compliance and Ethical Considerations
- Transparent data usage
- User consent management
- Privacy-first design
- Inclusive matching options

## Future Expansion Roadmap
- AI-powered conversation suggestions
- Advanced psychological compatibility testing
- Virtual date planning features
- Integration with third-party personality assessments
```
